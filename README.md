## Introduction  
You can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between multiple shapes in Sketch through this plugin.

**Notice: you should use SAME SHAPES to do the blend trick.**

### For Rectengles 
You can try to blend their Radius, Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size, Position
  
### For any other shapes  
Same as Rectangles, but can not blend their Radius.
  
### For Vectors (irregular shape):  
You can copied the original shape. Change the copied shape's Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size or Position. Then apply the blend tool on them.

## Usage  
1. Select shapes(more than 2) that you want to blend.<br>
2. Then you will see a input box. Type the number of steps you want between those shapes.<br>
3. Then you get it!<br>
