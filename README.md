## Introduction  
Through this Plugin, you can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between multiple objects in Sketch.

*Notice: you should use SAME SHAPES to do the blend trick.*
<br><br>
### Rectengles 
You can try to blend their Radius, Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size, Position
  
### Other shapes  
Same as Rectangles, but can not blend their Radius.
  
### Vectors (irregular shape):  
You can copied the original shape. Change the copied shape's Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size or Position. Then apply the blend tool on them.
<br><br>
## Usage  
1. Select shapes(more than 2) that you want to blend.<br>
2. Then you will see a input box. Type the number of steps you want between those shapes.<br>
3. Then you get it!<br>
