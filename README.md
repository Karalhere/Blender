## Installation
1. Download through this link: <a href="https://github.com/bunnieabc/Blender/raw/master/download/Blender.zip">**Blender Version 1.0**</a> <br>
2. Double click to install it.<br>
3. Then you can find it in "Plugins" in Sketch.<br>
<br><br>

## Introduction  
Through this Plugin, you can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between multiple objects in Sketch.

*Notice: you should use SAME SHAPES to do the blend trick.*
<br><br>
### Rectangles 
You can try to blend their Radius, Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size, Position
<br>
### Other shapes  
Same as Rectangles, but can not blend their Radius.
<br>
### Vectors (irregular shape):  
You should copy the original shape. Change the copied shape's Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size or Position. Then apply the blend tool on them.<br>
Notice: In this version, you cannot change the copied shape's anchor points. ;)
<br>
### Texts
If you want to create a guideline for Headers, it could be useful. You can blend their Font size, Position, Character Spacing, Line Height and Text Color.

<br><br>
## Usage  
1. Create shapes and put them in the right order since it will start from the bottom of the selected layers.<br>
2. Select shapes(more than 2) that you want to blend.<br>
3. Then you will see a input box. Type the number of steps you want between those shapes.<br>
4. Then you get it!<br>
