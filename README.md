## Instruction  
You can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between multiple shapes in Sketch through this plugin.

Notice: you should use **SAME SHAPES** to do the blend trick.  
(This is only version 1.0, so....LOL)

### For Rectengles:  
You can try to blend Rectangle' Radius, Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size, Position

### For any other shapes:  
Same as Rectangles, but can not blend their Radius.

### For Vectors (irregular shape):  
You can copied the original shape. Change the copied shape's Fill, Border, Opacity, Rotate, Size or Position. Then apply the blend tool on them.
